# Welcome to Tech-Task Storybook

## Storybook

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

## Tech Task Storybook

I created this storybook as part of my onboarding plan at Homeday, to get used to the tools used on a daily base.

### Examples

Here you can find some components I just created for the sake of testing storybook.

### Components

In components you can find actual components out of my project.

### Pages

Pages shows you the views and pages I created out of my components.
